Ueakeia hails from Tarawa, Kiribati and is the founder and former chairperson of the Kiribati Women in Mapping organization. Back in 2019, Ueakeia started using open source geospatial/OSM, when she realized how important OSM and open source geospatial is in decision making and development. She was led to the open-source geospatial community by the desire of maintaining and building on her geospatial skills, and to be around her kind of people. Ueakeia is currently a student of the University of Queensland, pursuing a Master in Geospatial Information Science. In 2021 was appointed to the She Lead, She Inpires program established by Humanitarian OSM Team's Open Mapping Hub - Asia Pacific.
