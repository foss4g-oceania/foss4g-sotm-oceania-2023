### What to contribute

The global FOSS4G is the flagship event of OSGeo and one of the most important global geospatial events of the year. While the focus of the conference revolts around open source software for geography, it is a meeting point where knowledge and experiences are shared, new tools are learned and new relationships are established.
Some of the expected topics will be the usage of geospatial in a variety of industries and in the public sector, the role of the community and industry in research and advancement in the free and open source geospatial technology to achieve the digital transition.
