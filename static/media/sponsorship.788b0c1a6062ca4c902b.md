# FOSS4G and State of the Map: Information for sponsors

FOSS4G SotM Oceania is a regional event that brings together the open source geospatial community. FOSS4G stands for 'Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial' and has been used since 2006 as a label for international and regional conferences of the [Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo)](http://osgeo.org/). OSGeo supports the development and adoption of open source geospatial technology. FOSS4G is part of the broader [open source software philosophy](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source).
<br /><br />
SotM is an acronym for 'State of the Map'. It is an annual conference organised by the OpenStreetMap Foundation, giving individuals and organisations a platform to discuss the development of the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) project. OpenStreetMap is a long-running effort to build a free and open editable map of the world. State of the Map conferences take place around the world at a local and international level, giving participants the chance to discuss the wider strategy of the project, tools that support it, and share case studies that can inspire others.
<br /><br />
Given the alignment between these two projects, we have amalgamated them into one conference to focus Oceania's open source geospatial efforts. The conference also gives Oceania a link to global communities of developers and users; supported by OSGeo and the OpenStreetMap Foundation.
<br /><br />
In 2023 the conference is being held in Auckland, New Zealand, the ‘City of Sails’  and a hive of geospatial activity.
<br /><br />

### Attendee Profile

Previous FOSS4G SotM Oceania conferences in Melbourne, Wellington and Suva were an overwhelming success:
<br /><br />
- Melbourne and Wellington were sold out with over 250 attendees at each conference
- Over 14 countries from Oceania and further afield such as Canada, the UK, and the USA have attended in the past
- Attendees included GIS professionals, developers, hobbyists, humanitarian workers, and government agencies
<br /><br />

Sponsors of FOSS4G SotM Oceania gain access to a diverse group of people shaping the evolution of open source geospatial software. The conference is a healthy mix of both software developers and end users.
<br /><br />

### What happens at FOSS4G SotM Oceania?

The conference is formally a three day event, with the program split between FOSS4G and State of the Map topics. As in previous years we'll be running a workshop day prior to the main program and a community day following the main program.
<br /><br />
The workshop day is an opportunity for professionals with deep subject matter experience and technical expertise to share their knowledge with others in a hands-on environment. Those attending the workshop day are able to interactively learn high-demand technical skills with expert practitioners.
<br /><br />
The community day opens up the FOSS4G SotM Oceania community to a wider audience; members of the general public are welcome to attend. Past activities have included a mapathon with the Australian Red Cross to improve public buildings and roads data in East Timor and a collaborative effort to import government data for public amenities into OpenStreetMap. Everyone is welcome to organise an event and encourage like-minded people to join them on the day.
<br /><br />

### Why you should sponsor FOSS4G SotM Oceania
<br />

#### **Exposure to a growing community**

The open source geospatial community has been growing from year to year. More and more organisations are incorporating desktop GIS such as QGIS and GRASS or geospatial libraries such as GDAL and PROJ into their geospatial toolset. OpenStreetMap is also strengthening as a project with 40,000 monthly active contributors and major companies such as Apple, Facebook, Grab and Microsoft working alongside the community to improve the map. Sponsorship gives you prominent exposure to each of these players and allows you to show where your organisation fits into the community.
<br /><br />

#### **Support the development of open source geospatial**

The FOSS4G SotM Oceania Conference is administered by a non-profit organisation, so any surplus generated from the conference is reinvested back into the community. This can include the support of smaller regional events and new initiatives that increase participation and the quality of contributions in the community.
<br /><br />

#### **Support an inclusive conference**

Sponsorship has allowed us to lower the ticket prices for students and community members financing their attendance with personal funds. This is incredibly important for the sustainability of open source geospatial and the diversity of ideas at the conference.

<br /><br />
### Who runs FOSS4G SotM Oceania?

The success of FOSS4G SotM Oceania 2018 illustrated the need for a longer-term governance structure for Oceania's geospatial community. A working group was established at the conclusion of the conference and tasked with investigating a suitable entity to support the community. From this, [OSGeo Oceania](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Oceania) was formed as a  not-for-profit entity.  OSGeo Oceania supports the long-term sustainability of the community and formalises the relationship between the OSGeo foundation and the OpenStreetMap Foundation.
<br /><br />
A dedicated and experienced conference committee has been established to focus on the delivery of a successful FOSS4G SotM Oceania 2023 in Auckland, New Zealand.

### Good Mojo
The open source software community runs on an economy of giving.
<br /><br />
The Good Mojo concept gives people and organisations the opportunity to donate whatever they can afford, with contributions directly funding diversity and accessibility initiatives.
<br /><br />
The types of initiatives that Good Mojo aims to support in 2023 include:
<br /><br />
- Funding the Travel Grant Program that enables those in under-represented communities with a financial disadvantage to attend. This initiative is particularly focused on citizens of Pacific Island Countries and indigenous communities in Australia and New Zealand.
- Organising networking events for under-represented groups.
- Initiatives to create a child-friendly conference.
- Reducing the cost of attendance for community members who are self funded.
<br /><br />

Previously the Good Mojo program funded:
<br /><br />
- Travel grants for over 20 people attending previous conferences representing Australia, Fiji, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and Timor-Leste
- Catering for children attending the event
- Networking breakfasts for women in the open geospatial community; and travel grant recipients
<br /><br />

Please contact the sponsorship team if you're interested in adding some Good Mojo funds.
